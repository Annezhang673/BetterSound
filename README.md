# BetterSound

##### Project Description:

BetterSound is an android application that acts as a mobile assistant, notifying users to avoid areas that historically have noises above their comfort levels. By incorporating GooglePlay services to retrieve the real time location and detecting the decibel levels of sound detected by the device, BetterSound records the location where the noise is above usersâ€™ maximum comfort level and labeled them in the backend supported by firebase. Once labeled in the system, users will get notified when they are in the set radius of the location and suggested to avoid that area by a toast.
